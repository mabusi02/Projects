# Data Analysis Projects in R and Python and Academic Research Papers using Tableau and Microsoft Excel

These are some of the collaborative projects I have worked on using in Python and R. All of these projects contain elements of data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, model building and model evaluation. The core principle was to apply all the skills I have learnt in an academic setting on actual datasets. These projects utilize most of the Python and R packages predominantly used on various data science tasks e.g. Deep Learning, Tensor Flow, Neural Networks, RandomForests, Matplotlib, Decision Tree, Regression, etc,.  

Furthermore, there are two academic research papers examining Net Price Calculators, FTE enrollment, and Student Debt in Higher Education in the Midwest. Tableau and Microsoft Excel are the softwares I particularly used to visualize my research findings on these papers.
